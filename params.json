{"name":"Webtalk","tagline":"Talk to the Web through the magic of reinforcement learning","body":"In this paper we describe a novel system for interacting with web pages through natural language. The system uses policy gradient reinforcement learning to learn a policy mapping sentences to actions to be performed. We formally evaluate its ability to interact with a simple web form and informally demonstrate its utility on more complicated real-world pages. The system demonstrates the viability of using reinforcement learning to make the web accessible via natural language.\r\n\r\nLanguage is our most important interface with other humans, and expropriating it for computer systems is a well-studied topic. This project aimed to use language to control the largest single computer interface in the world: the web. Being able to control a web browser with language would, by the nature of the web, allow control of interfaces to do nearly anything: buy a plane ticket, read the news, or order dinner.\r\n\r\nUsing language as an interface presents two advantages in particular. The first is an accessibility benefit for users not able to use traditional input media like the mouse and keyboard. The second is the promise of a better understanding of how the web can be interacted with and automated.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
